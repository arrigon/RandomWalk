# Random walk + diffusion models in plant - insect interactions

In short, this script simulates the colonization of a landscape by two lineages of plants and insects, starting from refugial cells located at each extremity of the landscape the idea is simply to show that co-dispersing organisms will share their biogeographic patterns, until the complete landscape is colonized. This pattern then vanishes unless co-dispersal is mandatory.

This simulation was used to produce the Figure 3 in Borer et al. 2012:
